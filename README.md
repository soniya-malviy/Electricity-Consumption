# Mining Electricity Consumption Data for Resource Allocation and Supply Chain Enhancement

## Project Overview
This project analyzes electricity consumption data to provide data-driven insights for infrastructure investment, distribution optimization, and supply chain enhancement. The analysis focuses on identifying demand patterns, forecasting future needs, and recommending strategic investments in grid infrastructure.

## Research Questions

1. **Temporal and Regional Variations**: How does electricity usage vary by region, time of day, and season?
2. **Demand Spikes**: Are there recurring demand spikes that could stress the grid (e.g., during summer heatwaves or festivals)?
3. **Sector Analysis**: How do residential vs. commercial vs. industrial users differ in consumption?
4. **Forecasting**: Can we forecast electricity demand for the next 5–10 years in specific regions?
5. **Risk Assessment**: Which areas are at risk of under-supply if current trends continue?
