# Research Hypotheses

This folder documents our research hypotheses, their evolution, and testing plans.

## Overview

Our hypotheses are organized by:
- **Initial Hypotheses**: Starting hypotheses based on literature and domain knowledge
- **Refined Hypotheses**: Updated hypotheses after data exploration
- **Innovation Statement**: What makes our hypotheses novel
- **Testing Plan**: How we validate each hypothesis

## Evaluation Criteria

For **Innovation in Hypotheses (20 marks)**, we need:
- ✅ **Novel and Insightful**: Original, not generic
- ✅ **Ambitious**: Challenge existing assumptions
- ✅ **Well-Founded**: Based on literature and theory
- ✅ **Testable**: Can be validated with data

## Hypothesis Categories

1. **Temporal Patterns**
   - Daily, weekly, seasonal variations
   - Demand spikes and peaks

2. **Regional Variations**
   - Geographic differences in consumption
   - Regional growth patterns

3. **Sector Differences**
   - Residential vs commercial vs industrial
   - Sector-specific patterns

4. **Risk Factors**
   - Under-supply risk identification
   - Infrastructure bottlenecks

5. **Forecasting**
   - Demand prediction accuracy
   - Long-term trends

- `refined_hypotheses.md` - Updated after EDA
- `innovation_statement.md` - Novel contributions
- `hypothesis_testing_plan.md` - Validation strategy

## Hypothesis Template

For each hypothesis, document:
1. **Statement**: Clear, testable hypothesis
2. **Rationale**: Why we believe this
3. **Literature Support**: Related research
4. **Testing Method**: How we validate it
5. **Expected Outcome**: What we expect to find
6. **Innovation**: What makes it novel
