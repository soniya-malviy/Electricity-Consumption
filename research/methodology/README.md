# Research Methodology

This folder contains documentation of our research methodology, theoretical foundation, and approach.

## Overview

Our methodology documentation covers:
- Theoretical foundation
- Research design
- Model selection rationale
- Validation strategy
- Limitations and assumptions

## Evaluation Criteria

For **Research Methodology (20 marks)**, we need:
- ✅ **Literature-Grounded**: Based on established research
- ✅ **Technically Sound**: Appropriate methods and techniques
- ✅ **Well-Documented**: Clear explanation of approach
- ✅ **Proactive**: Anticipates challenges and addresses them

## Key Documents

- `theoretical_foundation.md` - Theoretical basis for our approach
- `research_design.md` - Overall research design
- `model_selection_rationale.md` - Why we chose specific models
- `validation_strategy.md` - How we validate our results
- `limitations_assumptions.md` - Known limitations and assumptions

## Methodology Framework

Our research follows this framework:

1. **Theoretical Foundation** → Based on energy economics, time series theory
2. **Research Design** → Exploratory → Predictive → Risk Assessment
3. **Data Collection** → EIA API + additional sources
4. **Preprocessing** → Cleaning → Feature Engineering
5. **Analysis** → EDA → Forecasting → Risk Analysis
6. **Validation** → Model validation → Sensitivity analysis
7. **Interpretation** → Findings → Recommendations
