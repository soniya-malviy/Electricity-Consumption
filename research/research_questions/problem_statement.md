# Problem Statement

## Executive Summary

Electricity demand is not uniform—it varies across regions, industries, and time (daily, weekly, seasonal, and yearly cycles). Efficient allocation of resources requires identifying where demand is rising, where supply bottlenecks exist, and what areas (geographic or industrial) need immediate investment in grid infrastructure, generation, or renewable energy support.

This project challenges us to analyze electricity consumption data to propose data-driven insights on where governments and utility companies should invest in infrastructure, optimize distribution, or enhance supply chains.

## Problem Context

### The Challenge

Modern electricity grids face increasing pressure from:
1. **Growing Demand**: Population growth, urbanization, and economic development drive increased electricity consumption
2. **Variable Demand**: Demand patterns vary significantly by time, location, and sector
3. **Supply Constraints**: Limited generation capacity, aging infrastructure, and transmission bottlenecks
4. **Climate Impact**: Extreme weather events increase peak demand and stress grid reliability
5. **Renewable Integration**: Transitioning to renewable energy requires understanding demand patterns

### Why This Matters

**Economic Impact**: Electricity shortages can cause:
- Economic losses from power outages (estimated $150 billion annually in the US)
- Reduced industrial productivity
- Increased costs for emergency generation

**Social Impact**: Grid reliability affects:
- Public health (hospitals, emergency services)
- Quality of life (heating, cooling, lighting)
- Safety and security

**Environmental Impact**: Understanding demand patterns enables:
- Efficient renewable energy integration
- Reduced reliance on fossil fuels
- Optimized grid operations

## Research Gap

While extensive research exists on:
- ✅ Electricity demand forecasting
- ✅ Regional consumption patterns
- ✅ Grid infrastructure planning

**Our research addresses the gap by:**
1. **Integrated Analysis**: Combining temporal, regional, and sectoral dimensions simultaneously
2. **Predictive Risk Assessment**: Identifying future at-risk regions with timelines
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic identification of primary causes of supply risk
4. **Actionable Recommendations**: Translating analysis into prioritized investment guidance

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To provide data-driven insights for infrastructure investment, distribution optimization, and supply chain enhancement by analyzing electricity consumption patterns, forecasting future demand, and identifying at-risk regions.

### Specific Objectives

1. **Pattern Identification**: Identify temporal, regional, and sectoral patterns in electricity consumption
2. **Demand Forecasting**: Develop accurate forecasting models for 5-10 year projections
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify regions at risk of under-supply with root cause analysis
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Provide prioritized, actionable investment recommendations
5. **Visualization**: Create interactive tools for exploring consumption patterns and risks

---

## Research Questions

Our research addresses five primary questions:

1. **Temporal and Regional Variations**: How does electricity usage vary by region, time of day, and season?
2. **Demand Spikes**: Are there recurring demand spikes that could stress the grid?
3. **Sector Analysis**: How do residential vs. commercial vs. industrial users differ in consumption?
4. **Forecasting**: Can we forecast electricity demand for the next 5–10 years in specific regions?
5. **Risk Assessment**: Which areas are at risk of under-supply if current trends continue?

## Scope and Limitations

### Scope
- **Geographic**: Focus on available regional data (US regions from EIA)
- **Temporal**: Historical data from 2010-2024 (or available period)
- **Sectors**: Residential, commercial, industrial consumption
- **Analysis**: Forecasting, risk assessment, and recommendations

### Limitations
- Data availability and quality constraints
- Limited to available regional data
- Assumptions about future trends (economic, technological, policy)
- External shocks (pandemics, policy changes) not fully captured
