# Research Questions

This folder documents our research questions, their evolution, and how they guide our research.

## Overview

Research questions are organized by:
- **Primary Questions**: Main research questions addressing core objectives
- **Exploratory Questions**: Questions for exploratory data analysis
- **Hypothesis Questions**: Questions for hypothesis testing
- **Evolution**: How questions evolved during research

## Evaluation Criteria

For **Problem Understanding (20 marks)**, we need:
- ✅ **Well-Defined**: Clear, specific questions
- ✅ **Theoretical Foundation**: Grounded in theory
- ✅ **Measurable**: Can be answered with data
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of the problem

## Primary Research Questions

### RQ1: Temporal and Regional Variations
**Question**: How does electricity usage vary by region, time of day, and season?

**Sub-questions**:
- What are the daily consumption patterns?
- How do seasonal variations differ by region?
- What factors drive regional differences?

**Theoretical Foundation**: Energy economics, geographic analysis
**Measurement**: Statistical analysis, pattern identification
**Expected Outcome**: Quantified patterns and regional differences

---

### RQ2: Demand Spikes
**Question**: Are there recurring demand spikes that could stress the grid?

**Sub-questions**:
- When do demand spikes occur?
- What causes these spikes?
- Which regions are most vulnerable?

**Theoretical Foundation**: Risk assessment, grid reliability
**Measurement**: Statistical analysis, peak identification
**Expected Outcome**: Identified spike patterns and vulnerable regions

---

### RQ3: Sector Differences
**Question**: How do residential vs. commercial vs. industrial users differ in consumption?

**Sub-questions**:
- What are sector-specific consumption patterns?
- How do sectors contribute to peak demand?
- What are sector-specific growth trends?

**Theoretical Foundation**: Sector analysis, energy economics
**Measurement**: Sector-wise analysis, comparison
**Expected Outcome**: Quantified sector differences

---

### RQ4: Forecasting
**Question**: Can we forecast electricity demand for the next 5–10 years in specific regions?

**Sub-questions**:
- What forecasting methods work best?
- How accurate are long-term forecasts?
- What factors affect forecast accuracy?

**Theoretical Foundation**: Time series theory, machine learning
**Measurement**: Model comparison, accuracy metrics
**Expected Outcome**: Validated forecasting models and projections

---

### RQ5: Risk Assessment
**Question**: Which areas are at risk of under-supply if current trends continue?

**Sub-questions**:
- What defines at-risk regions?
- What are the root causes of risk?
- What are the timelines for potential shortages?

**Theoretical Foundation**: Risk assessment, grid reliability
**Measurement**: Reserve margin analysis, growth trends
**Expected Outcome**: At-risk region list with root causes and timelines

## Exploratory Questions

1. What are the overall trends in electricity consumption?
2. Which regions have the highest consumption?
3. What are the peak demand periods?
4. How has consumption changed over time?
5. What correlations exist between consumption and other factors?

## Hypothesis Testing Questions

1. Do temporal patterns follow expected patterns?
2. Do regional variations correlate with economic factors?
3. Do sector differences follow theoretical expectations?
4. Do forecasting models outperform baselines?
5. Do at-risk regions share common characteristics?
