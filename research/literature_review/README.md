# Literature Review

This folder contains a comprehensive literature review of electricity consumption analysis, forecasting, and infrastructure planning.

## Overview

The literature review covers:
- Electricity demand forecasting methods
- Regional energy consumption patterns
- Grid infrastructure planning
- Demand response programs
- Renewable energy integration
- Risk assessment in energy systems

## Key Themes

   - Machine learning approaches
   - Regional demand patterns

2. **Infrastructure Planning**
   - Grid capacity planning
   - Investment prioritization
   - Supply chain optimization

3. **Regional Analysis**
   - Geographic variations in consumption
   - Economic factors affecting demand
   - Climate impact on electricity use

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Under-supply risk identification
   - Reserve margin analysis
   - Grid reliability assessment

## Target: 20-30+ Academic Papers

Each team member should review:
- **Minimum**: 5-7 academic papers
- **Industry Reports**: 3-5 reports
- **Government Publications**: 2-3 publications
- **Total**: 20-30+ references

## Citation Format

Use APA or IEEE format for citations. See `../references/references.md` for bibliography.

## Review Process

1. **Search**: Use Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library
2. **Read**: Skim abstracts, read full papers for key contributions
3. **Summarize**: Document key findings, methods, and gaps
4. **Synthesize**: Identify common themes and research gaps
5. **Cite**: Add to references bibliography
